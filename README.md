# Shayan (novincode) — Full-Stack Engineer

I build clean, performant, and edge-friendly web applications and tools. My work emphasizes maintainability, predictable APIs, and fast front-end experiences that scale.

## Focus
- Clean architecture, readable code, and reliable developer ergonomics  
- Edge-first deployments and performance optimizations  
- Automation: testing, CI/CD and reproducible development environments  

## Core Technologies
- **Frontend:** React · Next.js · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend & Data:** Drizzle ORM · PostgreSQL · Node.js  
- **Automation & Testing:** Playwright · Web scraping (headless browsers, resilient crawlers)  
- **Infrastructure & Tooling:** Docker · Git · Bash · Edge platforms (Vercel/Cloudflare)  
- **Workflow:** CI/CD (GitHub Actions), containerized local development  

## Selected Work

## How I Work
- I prefer small, focused PRs with clear descriptions and tests.  
- I use Tailwind for consistent, utility-first UIs and avoid brittle global CSS.  
- I treat edge compatibility as a first-class concern: keep code size small, avoid Node-only APIs where possible, and optimize cold starts.
