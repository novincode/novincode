# Shayan (novincode)

Nobody special. I just write code on the internet.
Sometimes it works.💀

### About me

* Not senior. Not junior. Just lost.
* I break things until they behave.
* Building open source because why not.
* Here for good vibes, real work, no corporate bullshit.

---

### Things I mess with

JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, React, Next.js, random side projects , accidental bugs.

---

### Projects that suck less

* **LexKit** – A headless rich text editor I probably over-engineered
  [https://lexkit.dev](https://lexkit.dev)
* **Flowshot** – Turns Markdown into slides because typing is easier than designing
  [https://github.com/novincode/flowshot](https://github.com/novincode/flowshot)

---

### Current status

* Solo building
* Learning out loud
* Accepting chaos

---

### Support

⭐ Stars keep this repo alive
☕ Coffee donations prevent me from changing career to singing (no one wants that)
