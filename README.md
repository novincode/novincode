### About me

* Not senior. Not junior. Just lost.
* I break things until they behave.
* Building open source because why not.
* Here for good vibes, real work, no corporate bullshit.

---

### Things I mess with

JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, React, Next.js, random side projects , accidental bugs.

---

### Projects that suck less

* **LexKit** ‚Äì A headless rich text editor I probably over-engineered
  [https://lexkit.dev](https://lexkit.dev)
* **Flowshot** ‚Äì Turns Markdown into slides because typing is easier than designing

### Current status

* Solo building
* Learning out loud
* Accepting chaos

---

### Support
