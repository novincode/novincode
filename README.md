## 🚀 About Me

I’m passionate about building clean, polished, and maintainable web applications. With a strong foundation in React and Next.js, I strive to deliver user-focused experiences and developer-friendly codebases. I love automation and DevOps workflows, so you’ll often find me writing scripts in Bash or containerizing projects with Docker.

- 🌱 Currently building and evolving **[Lexkit.dev](https://lexkit.dev)** – a rich text editor framework powered by Facebook’s Lexical.
- 💬 Ask me about front-end architecture, CI/CD pipelines, or why clean code matters.
- ⚡ Fun Fact: I believe that a great README is the first chapter of any awesome open-source project.
