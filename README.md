# Shayan (novincode)

Nobody special. I just write code on the internet.
Sometimes it works.💀

### About me

* Not senior. Not junior. Just lost.
* I break things until they behave.
* Building open source because why not.
* Here for good vibes, real work, no corporate bullshit.

---

### Things I mess with

JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, React, Next.js, Python, random side projects , accidental bugs.
