# Shayan (novincode) — Full-Stack Engineer

I build clean, performant, and edge-friendly web applications and tools. My work emphasizes maintainability, predictable APIs, and fast front-end experiences that scale.

## Focus
- Clean architecture, readable code, and reliable developer ergonomics
- Edge-first deployments and performance optimizations
- Automation: testing, CI/CD and reproducible development environments

## Core Technologies
- Frontend: React · Next.js · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS
- Backend & Data: Drizzle ORM · PostgreSQL · Node.js
- Automation & Testing: Playwright · Web scraping (headless browsers, resilient crawlers)
- Infrastructure & Tooling: Docker · Git · Bash · Edge platforms (Vercel/Cloudflare)
- Workflow: CI/CD (GitHub Actions), containerized local development

## Selected Work
- Lexkit.dev — Rich text editor framework built on Facebook's Lexical. A modular, extensible editor designed for performance and real-world production use. (https://lexkit.dev / https://github.com/novincode/lexkit)
- Figma Flow Capture GUI — Desktop tool (TypeScript + Rust) for capturing and automating Figma snapshots into developer workflows. (https://github.com/novincode/figma-flow-capture-gui)
- Flowshot — CLI and library to generate slides from Markdown and automate presentations. (https://github.com/novincode/flowshot)

## How I Work
- I prefer small, focused PRs with clear descriptions and tests.
- I use Tailwind for consistent, utility-first UIs and avoid brittle global CSS.
- I treat edge compatibility as a first-class concern: keep code size small, avoid Node-only APIs where possible, and optimize cold starts.

If you want a concise developer overview or a project README tailored for one of my repos (Lexkit, Flowshot, etc.), I can produce that next.
